# sulky üòü

sulky is a information manipulation framework for writers and thinkers. sulky allows you to organise ideas, thoughts, lists, information, and manipulate them. sulky lets you play with information programatically and visually, using arbitrarily defined units of information as building blocks for creative works. 

Thus, ‚Äúsulky‚Äù is two things: 

1. a framework for organising information; and 
2. a [free software](http://www.fsf.org/) tool, written in JavaScript, that is an implementation of the framework and a proof-of-concept.

# The problems sulky solves

## The film conversation problem

You've seen a lot of films. You like some of them. You want to talk about them to people you meet? How do you do it? You realise that movies fall into certain stylistic groups. Films are [remixed](http://everythingisaremix.info/) from each other, and depend on each other in interesting ways.

In other ways, the *metadata* of the films is what defines your contribution to this conversation. 

So if you want to capture the essence of every serious conversation about films, you can't just make a list of the movies you've seen/liked. That isn't enough. What we need is a data structure that can capture:

* the relationships between movies (derivations, etc)
* the temporal order they came out in
* the temporal order *you* saw them in
* a ranking system
* a categorisation system

`sulky` solves these problems. 

## The Wikipedia problem
