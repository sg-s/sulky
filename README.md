# sulky üòü

sulky is a information manipulation framework for writers and thinkers. sulky allows you to organise ideas, thoughts, lists, information, and manipulate them. sulky lets you play with information programatically and visually, using arbitrarily defined units of information as building blocks for creative works. 

Thus, ‚Äúsulky‚Äù is two things: 

1. a framework for organising information; and 
2. a free software tool, written in JavaScript, that is an implementation of the framework and a proof-of-concept.
