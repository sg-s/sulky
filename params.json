Sulky can be used to generate a rich, inter-linked web of information about a specific topic. Sulky can generate rich documents that allow you to non-linearly read its contents. Sulky organizes information hierarchically, so you can quickly understand what a particular node of information is about, and then dig in if you want to know more. \r\n\r\n## Principles \r\n\r\n### Graph Structure \r\n\r\nInformation lives on a ```graph```, which is a fancy way of saying a network. A graph is made up of `nodes`, which contain various flavors of information, and `edges`, which connect two nodes, and may themselves contain information. \r\n\r\n### Nodes in many flavors \r\n\r\n### Edges in many flavors \r\n\r\n### Hierarchically nested nodes \r\n\r\n### Time \r\n\r\n## Applications \r\n\r\n### Journal/Autobiography \r\n\r\n### Non-linear storytelling \r\n\r\n### A web of knowledge \r\n\r\n## UI","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
